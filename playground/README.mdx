# Improve Error Accessibility for Screen Readers

Not everyone can see the user interface you build. And if they can see it, not
everyone can see it very well. So many people use a technology called a "screen
reader" is software that reads the user interface to them.

But sometimes the screen readers need extra help. Crafting good experiences for
users of screen readers is surprisingly difficult for a few reasons:

1. There are many screen readers and they all operate slightly differently
2. While there is [a spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/), screen reader
   makers acknowledge that many software engineers don't follow it so they try
   to get creative to be more helpful, but that in turn makes it operate
   differently than you might expect.

Because of this, it's good to actually test your software with a real screen
reader (or, even better, multiple) to make sure it behaves well with what you've
built.

Operating systems have screen readers built-in:

- Mac:
  [VoiceOver Desktop](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac)
- iOS:
  [VoiceOver iOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-iph3e2e415f/ios)
- Windows:
  [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1)
- Android:
  [TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/topic/3529932)
- Linux: [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Orca)

However, there are many alternatives (some paid and others open source). Here
are two:

- [JAWS](https://support.freedomscientific.com/JAWSHQ/JAWSHeadquarters01) (Paid
  and Windows-only)
- [NV Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (Open Source and Windows-only)

At the end of the day, it's an enormous challenge to test your software on all
of these screen readers (especially since automated testing in this space is
very difficult to be reliable). So just do your best to follow the spec and
carve out some time to test your software out with screen readers to make sure
that it is sensible.

With that said, our simple form is pretty good, but could be improved. Here are
a few improvements for you to add and try it out with whatever screen reader you
have available (yes, I expect you to actually figure out how to start it up if
you've never done it before).

1. Add `required` to the `<input />`
2. Add `pattern` to the `<input />` that enforces 3-10 lowercase characters (use
   a regex,

3. Add `noValidate` to the `<form>` to prevent the browser from displaying error
   messages related to those new attributes because we're already showing a more
   custom error message.
4. Add `name` to the `<form>` to give the form an implicit role of "form" (ðŸ“œ

5. Add `role="alert"` to the error message `div` so screen readers will read the
   message. (ðŸ“œ
