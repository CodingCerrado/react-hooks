# Initialize State

Often the reason you split React code into different components is for code
reuse. Just like with regular functions, you can add arguments (props) to
configure the behavior of the function.

üë®‚Äçüíº Let's assume that our `UsernameForm` will be used by different pages of our
application and some of those will need to initialize the `username` state to
something specific, while others will not.

Make the `UsernameForm` accept a prop called `initialUsername` and initialize
the `username` state to that value. (Remember, the value you pass to the
`React.useState` call will be the initial value). You'll also want to make sure
that you handle the situations where an `initialUsername` is not passed and
default that prop to an empty string for when it's not provided.

Go ahead and test it out by updating the `App` component to pass an
`initialUsername` prop along. The test will automatically detect when you've
added the `initialUsername` prop to your component and it can also validate
you've got things working properly as well.

To be clear, start by updating the `App` to have this:

```tsx
<UsernameForm onSubmitUsername={onSubmitUsername} initialUsername="kody" />
```

Once you've finished implementing this feature, you can change that back and
remove the `initialUsername="kody"` if you want.
