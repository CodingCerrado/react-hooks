# Managing UI State

This exercise should be familiar if you've been through the
[React Fundamentals](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals) workshop
already. Rather than retrieving the value of the input out of the
`form.elements`, we're going to keep track of the value in a state variable
called `username` and when the user submits the form we'll be able to simply
submit that variable.

The benefits of this approach will become apparent in the extra credit. We just
want to get you going on using the `React.useState` hook for the exercise.
