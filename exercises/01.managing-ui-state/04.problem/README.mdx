# Improve Error UX

I don't know about you, but having an error message yelling at me before I've
had a chance to fill out the field is really annoying. What I think would be
better is if we wait until the user has focused on the input and then unfocused
it (this is called "blur"-ing the input).

Here's how you create a `onBlur` event handler:

```tsx
function handleBlur() {
  // the user blurred the input...
}
const element = <input onBlur={handleBlur} />
```

So we shouldn't show the error if the form is valid and we shouldn't show it
unless the user has blurred the input. We've already got the validity working,
now we just need to keep track of whether the user has blurred the input. To do
that, we'll need some new state.

Create some new state (with another `React.useState` call) called `showError`
and start it out as `false`. Then use the `onBlur` event to set that state to
`true`.

Also, if the user skips the input and just clicks "submit" it should show the
error as well.
