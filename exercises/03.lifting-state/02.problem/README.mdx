# Colocating State

As a community we’re pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
One thing that we typically have trouble remembering to do is to push state back
down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

👨‍💼 Peter told us that now users only want the animal displayed instead of the
name:

```javascript
function Display({animal}) {
  return <div>{`Your favorite animal is: ${animal}!`}</div>
}
```

You'll notice that just updating the `Display` component to this works fine, but
for the extra credit, go through the process of moving state to the components
that need it (this type of change happens more often in real applications than
you might realize). Basically, you know what you just did for the `Animal`
component? You need to do the opposite thing for the `Name` component.

🦉 A lot of folks asked me to add a note here that you really should be reading
the articles included in these instructions. If you skip those you're missing
out on some important learnings 😉
