# Removing Unnecessary Controlled State

You may have noticed by now that the `Name` component doesn't actually need the
`useState` at all to work. We've made the `input` "controlled" by providing the
`value` and `onChange` props, but we're not actually doing anything with that
state and we're not changing the `value` to anything that would be different
from what the browser does by default.

So go ahead and remove the `useState` in the `Name` component.

The point of this extra credit is to just illustrate that just because you have
an `input` doesn't mean it needs to be controlled. You really only need a
controlled input when you're going to programmatically change the `value` of
that input. Otherwise it's just extra work for no benefit.

In a practical situation, you'd do this if you just need to access the value
when the containing form is submitted.
