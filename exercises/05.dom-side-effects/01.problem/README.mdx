# DOM Side-Effects

For this extra credit we're going to auto-focus on the username input if there's
an error after submitting. This is a common practice for accessibility purposes
(to focus on the first input that has an error after a form submission).

So for this exercise you're going to use `useRef`. The example above should be
enough to get you working. You'll pass the ref you create to the input and then
in a `useEffect` you'll call `.focus()` on the input element whenever the error
is displayed.
