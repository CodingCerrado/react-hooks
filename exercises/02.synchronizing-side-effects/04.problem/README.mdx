# Custom Hook

The best part of hooks is that if you find a bit of logic inside your component
function that you think would be useful elsewhere, you can put that in another
function and call it from the components that need it (just like regular
JavaScript). These functions you create are called "custom hooks".

Create a custom hook called `useLocalStorageState` for reusability of all this
logic.

ðŸ¦‰ Note: you're in control of the arguments and return value of your custom
hook, there are no rules. Just like regular functions. Cool huh?

ðŸ’° For my solution, the end result allows people to use it like this:

```tsx
const [username, setUsername] = useLocalStorageState(
  'username',
  initialUsername,
)
```

This allows people to swap between `React.useState` and `useLocalStorageState`
pretty easily.

ðŸ¦º If you struggle on how to type the return value of your `useLocalStorage`
hook, check
