# Synchronizing Side-Effects

`React.useEffect` is a built-in hook that allows you to run some custom code
after React renders (and re-renders) your component to the DOM. It accepts a
callback function which React will call after the DOM has been updated:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  // your side-effect code here.
  // this is where you can make HTTP requests or interact with browser APIs.
})
```

`useState` is for managing our react component state and `useEffect` is for
synchronizing the our react component state with the everything outside our
react components.

For example, things outside our react components include:

- Remote server requests
- Browser APIs like local storage/document title/media devices/etc.
- Integrations with non-react code

Feel free to take a look at `src/examples/hook-flow.png` if you're interested in
the timing of when your functions are run. This will make more sense after
finishing the exercises/extra credit/instruction.
