# Flexible localStorage Hook

Take your custom `useLocalStorageState` hook and make it generic enough to
support any data type (remember, you have to serialize objects to strings... use
`JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`). Note: this one's a bit of a challenge, but
have fun with it!

ðŸ¦‰ NOTE: So far, we've been saving the string as-is. Now we're making our custom
hook support any data type (number/boolean/etc). This means that we'll be
serializing it and that means that strings will be set to `"string value"`
rather than simply `string value`. So I recommend you clear your devtools local
storage value when you implement your changes (or even better, add support for
what to do when deserialization fails).
