# Use React-Error-Boundary

As cool as our own `ErrorBoundary` is, I'd rather not have to maintain it in the
long-term. Luckily for us, there's an npm package we can use instead and it's
already installed into this project. It's called
[`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary).

Go ahead and give that a look and swap out our own `ErrorBoundary` for the one
from `react-error-boundary`.

ðŸ’° It is important to note that `react-error-boundary` do _not_ handle all type
of errors. In our example it works nicely because as mentioned in extra credit 4
that we are throwing error right in the function. It can also happen that some
errors are not handled by `react-error-boundary`. To learn more about how to
handle all type of error you can read
