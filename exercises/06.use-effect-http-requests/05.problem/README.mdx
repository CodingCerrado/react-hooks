# Create an ErrorBoundary Component

We've already solved the problem for errors in our request, we're only handling
that one error. But there are a lot of different kinds of errors that can happen
in our applications.

No matter how hard you try, eventually your app code just isnâ€™t going to behave
the way you expect it to and youâ€™ll need to handle those exceptions. If an error
is thrown and unhandled, your application will be removed from the page, leaving
the user with a blank screen... Kind of awkward...

Luckily for us, thereâ€™s a simple way to handle errors in your application using
a special kind of component called an
[Error Boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary).
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to create an Error Boundary component
with a function and you have to use a class component instead.

In this extra credit, read up on ErrorBoundary components, and try to create one
that handles this and any other error for the `PokemonInfo` component.

ðŸ’° to make your error boundary component handle errors from the `PokemonInfo`
component, instead of rendering the error within the `PokemonInfo` component,
you'll need to `throw error` right in the function so React can hand that to the
error boundary. So `if (status === 'rejected') throw error`.
