# Reset the Error Boundary

You may have noticed a problem with the way we're resetting the internal state
of the `ErrorBoundary` using the `key`. Unfortunately, we're not only
re-mounting the `ErrorBoundary`, we're also re-mounting the `PokemonInfo` which
results in a flash of the initial "Submit a pokemon" state whenever we change
our pokemon.

So let's backtrack on that and instead we'll use `react-error-boundary`'s
`resetErrorBoundary` function (which will be passed to our `ErrorFallback`
component) to reset the state of the `ErrorBoundary` when the user clicks a "try
again" button.

Once you have this button wired up, we need to react to this reset of the
`ErrorBoundary`'s state by resetting our own state so we don't wind up
triggering the error again. To do this we can use the `onReset` prop of the
`ErrorBoundary`. In that function we can simply `setPokemonName` to an empty
string.
