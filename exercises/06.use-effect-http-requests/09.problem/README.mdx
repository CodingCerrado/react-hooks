# Use resetKeys

Unfortunately now the user can't simply select a new pokemon and continue with
their day. They have to first click "Try again" and then select their new
pokemon. I think it would be cooler if they can just submit a new `pokemonName`
and the `ErrorBoundary` would reset itself automatically.

Luckily for us `react-error-boundary` supports this with the `resetKeys` prop.
You pass an array of values to `resetKeys` and if the `ErrorBoundary` is in an
error state and any of those values change, it will reset the error boundary.

ðŸ’° Your `resetKeys` prop should be: `[pokemonName]`
