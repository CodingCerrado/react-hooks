# useEffect: HTTP Requests

In this exercise, we'll be doing data fetching directly in a useEffect hook
callback within our component.

Here we have a form where users can enter the name of a pokemon and fetch data
about that pokemon. Your job will be to create a component which makes that
fetch request. When the user submits a pokemon name, our `PokemonInfo` component
will get re-rendered with the `pokemonName`
